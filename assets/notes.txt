 // get index from user - check

// delete element at index possition - check

// diplay new element index possotions in index table 
  // replace current table with remaining elements 
    // remove current table - check
    // render new array state as table 



    current issue's 
      after an element is deleted, only the element at index is deleted
      which is good but if there are more than
      on element left, it displays only one element instead 
      of looping through and diplaying all elements.

    started trying 
    displayIndexTable.productsArr[i].insertAdjacentHTML
    but it made more issues and didnt fix anything

    sleep on it and try again in the morning with a 
    fresh brain 

    im missing the reason it displays in storeProduct()
    and not in deleteProduct() --


make vertical table in html w/index
get element index value
inside showTable render new table
